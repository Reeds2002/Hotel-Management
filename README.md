# SS2 Hotel Management System

Website developed with the Django framework. Users are able to view and book hotel rooms. Previous bookings can also be viewed on users' profile. Users with admin rights are able to view extra information about the rooms, for example who is staying there and whether the room has been cleaned on that day. Admin users can also go to the admin panel and edit room properties.
